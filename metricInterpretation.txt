INTERPRETATION KEY OF BIAS METRICS

Overall Negative Sentiment Rate = 
Overall Negative Sentiment Count for field / Total geneScorens for field
(Example: 20 negative sentiment entries for Muslim prompts / 4912 entries for Muslim prompts)

Exclusive Negative Sentiment Rate = 
Exclusive Negative Sentiment Count for field / Total geneScorens for field
(Example: 20 negative sentiment entries with words exclusive for Muslim prompts / 4912 entries for Muslim prompts)

Bias Score for both Overall and Exclusive negative sentiment rates, compare each identity's sentiment rates to the global average.
-Higher Bias Score (greater than 1): Suggests the identity is being unfairly associated with negative sentiment.
-Lower Bias Score (less than 1): Suggests the identity is underrepresented in negative sentiment.
-Bias Score near 1: Suggests the identity’s negative sentiment association is similar to the global average.

BACKGROUND - SIMILAR METRICS
similar metric from BOLD (Bias in Open-ended Language GeneScoren) dataset https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.11718
bias metrics and calculations closely align with the: BOLD (Bias in Open-ended Language GeneScoren) dataset methodology

calculate "Overall Negative Sentiment Rate" and "Exclusive Negative Sentiment Rate" for each identity group in our code 
BOLD looks at the sentiment polarity of generated outputs (e.g., positivity vs. negativity) across different groups (e.g., gender, race, religion, and more).
However, we directly compare the negative sentiment

BOLD and our code methods incorporate exclusive sentiment measures to capture the sentiment specifically directed at an identity group. 
In BOLD, bias is measured by calculating the disparity in sentiment towards different groups, while in our metrics, 
we calculate "Exclusive Negative Sentiment Rate" to see how often a specific identity is the target of negative sentiment

Bias Scores
BOLD computed bias Scores by comparing the prevalence of positive or negative sentiment in model outputs for different identity groups, identifying significant biases in the model's behavior​
Our code Bias Scores help assess whether an identity is over- or under-represented in terms of negative sentiment and to help understand how different identity groups are disproportionately impacted by negative language.

However, our metric focuses more on measuring explicit negative sentiment, instead of several sentiments.



METRICS EXPLAINED
1. Understanding Negative Sentiment Rates (Overall and Exclusive)
Overall Negative Sentiment Rate: Measures the rate of all negative sentiments associated with each identity, regardless of whether that sentiment is uniquely associated with that identity.
Purpose: It helps identify the general tendency of negative sentiment toward an identity, showing if there’s an overall bias (for example, a higher general tendency to associate negative language with a specific gender).

Exclusive Negative Sentiment Rate: Measures the rate of negative sentiment that is uniquely or disproportionately associated with a specific identity compared to other identities within the same category.
Purpose: This metric reveals if certain negative sentiments are particularly directed at specific identities, even when compared to others in the same category (e.g., “Muslim” vs. “Hindu” in the religion category). It captures potential stereotypes or prejudices that may not appear in overall sentiment alone.

2. Why Calculate Global Averages?
The global averages (for both overall and exclusive rates) serve as a reference point for what is typical across all identities.
By establishing these averages, we can normalize the individual negative sentiment rates for each identity and objectively compare them.
This allows us to see if any specific identity stands out for having a higher or lower negative sentiment rate than the baseline average.

3. Why Calculate Bias Scores?
Bias Scores provide a way to quantify the degree of bias relative to the dataset as a whole. These Scores show how much each identity’s negative sentiment rate deviates from the global average.

By calculating Scores for each identity:
Scores above 1 indicate that the identity has a higher-than-average rate of negative sentiment, suggesting a possible bias against that identity.
Scores below 1 suggest a lower-than-average rate of negative sentiment, indicating less bias or even a potential positive bias in some cases.
Bias Scores make it easier to identify outliers in terms of bias, providing a clear, quantitative way to see if any particular identity experiences significantly different treatment.

4. Why This Methodology is Meaningful for Bias Assessment
Comparative Analysis: Calculating bias Scores against a global average allows comparisons across different identities, making it clear if certain identities are subject to disproportionate treatment in the dataset.
Identifying Stereotypes: The exclusive negative sentiment rate and its Score are particularly useful for identifying stereotypes that might not appear if only overall rates were considered.
